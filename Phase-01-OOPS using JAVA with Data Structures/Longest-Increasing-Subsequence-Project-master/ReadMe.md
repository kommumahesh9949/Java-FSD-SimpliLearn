# DESCRIPTION
## Introduction: -
Longest Increasing Subsequence: -
The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.

## Problem statement: -
As a developer, write a Java code to find the longest increasing subsequence from a list of random numbers.
## Project objective: -
As a developer, write a program to find the longest increasing subsequence.

## Software Requirement: -
•	Operating system: - windows XP/7/10  
•	language Used: - Java  
•	Platform: - Eclipse  
•	Tools: - Git, GitHub   
## Terms and Concepts: - 
To write a simple program in Java, you should do research that enables you to understand the following terms and concepts.
## Core java concepts:
 -variables  
 -data types  
 -operators  
 -type casting  
 -class  
 -objects   
-access specifiers
## Other programming Concepts: -
Control Statement: - (if, else, else if)  
Core Keywords: -  
-This   
-final   
-Static   


## Feasibility study: -
- Technical analysis  
- Economic Analysis  
- performance Analysis  

## SWOT: -
SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and threats involved in a project.  
Strength - in which user can find the longest increasing subsequence from a list  
Weakness- there can be very small chances that the specific resources required by the user can't be available in the data  
Opportunity- we can search n numbers of elements where n<100  
Thread - without proper data we can't search the data. if condition is n>100  

## Conclusion: -
In this we can find the longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.
