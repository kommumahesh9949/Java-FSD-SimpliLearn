# DESCRIPTION
Email validation is pivotal in ascertaining the quality and accuracy of email addresses. Keeping non-existent, inactive, or mistyped email accounts can unnecessarily fill your contact lists, leading to reduced deliverability and hurting your promotion efforts.

A valid email address is comprised of three sections: a local part, the at-sign (@), and a domain name. If this format is not followed, then the address becomes invalid.

According to the specifications of most Internet mail systems, the local part may use any of the following ASCII standard characters.

## Project objective: -
As a developer, write a program to search a string entered by a user from the array of strings.
Problem statement: -
You have an array of email IDs of employees. As a programmer, write a program to search the email ID entered by a user.
## Abstract: -
You'll learn how to use Java program to create a basic email id validation program that you can run in your Console.
Objective: -
The objective of this project is. a developer, write a program to create an write a program to search a string entered by a user from the array of strings.
## Introduction: -
An email has its own structure, and before using it, we need to validate it. In Java, email validation is performed by using the regular expression. There are five ways through which we can perform email validation using a regular expression.
